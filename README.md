# Darts predictor
Next steps for data gathering:
- Using regular expressions, split each string in the text file based on capital letters / numerical values using regular expressions and the re package.
- Next goal is to end up with a dataframe with columns filled for one URL/championship.
- Then, try to generalize for all championships. IE: are all round names consistent and all pages consistent throughout the website?
- If dataframe is complete, extract to csv for easy development of the machine learning model

Then:
- Build machine learning model to predict wins (or #sets won?) (or something else? Use inspiration on score prediction models) 
- Find a scoring mechanism
- AI engineering from that point onwards
